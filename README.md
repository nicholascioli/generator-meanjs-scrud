# generator-meanjs-scrud

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for [MEAN.js](https://github.com/meanjs/mean/) CRUD modules


## Getting Started

This is a very VERY simple CRUD module generator for MEAN.js v0.4.0+.

In order to install, clone the source then run
```bash
npm install; npm link
```

## Usage

In order to use, change to the top level directory of your instance of MEAN.js and run
```bash
yo meanjs-scrud MODULE_NAME
```

That will generate a scaffold located in `modules/MODULE_NAME` that is **identical** to the example articles module. This is all that this module does at the moment.

Feel free to fork and add on to this module while the official MEAN.js is still not available.
